			"TRANSLATED_TEXT":"(Dajjal: among the great signs of the last hour and the greatest trials to befall mankind, which every Prophet has warned about.  Most of mankind will folow him. He will appear from Asbahan, Iran at the time when Muslims will conquer Constantinople.  He will be given special powers and will make the truth seem false and vice versa. He will claim to be righteous and then he will claim prophet-hood and finally, divinity. From his features is that he will be blind in his right eye which is a definite proof that contradicts his claim to be Allah as it is a sign of imperfection.  The word Kafir will be written between his eyes which every believer, literate or illiterate will recognise.)(Whoever memorises the first ten verses of soorat Al-Kahf will be protected from Dajjal.)(One should also seek refuge with Allah from the tribulations of the Dajjal after the last tashahhud in prayer.(Refer to supplications #55 & #56))",
